Yellow Phosphorus Price Trend: Drivers of Price Changes

The price of yellow phosphorus has shown regional divergence, with recent trends indicating volatility across global markets. In Q3 2025, prices ranged from USD 3.35/kg in Northeast Asia to USD 5.57/kg in North America, reflecting supply-demand dynamics. Prices have increased in regions like Europe and North America due to stable demand, while Northeast Asia faced a decline due to oversupply. In earlier years (2021–2022), prices were lower, around USD 2.80–3.20/kg.

From late 2023 to 2025, yellow phosphorus prices saw fluctuations. In Q3 2024, Asian prices rose, particularly in China, where the spot price climbed from USD 3,089/MT to USD 3,415/MT. Meanwhile, in North America, weak demand and high inventories led to softer pricing. By early 2025, the price in the US reached USD 4,410/ton, highlighting regional disparities.

Key drivers of price fluctuations include supply-side factors such as oversupply from major producers like China and Vietnam, as well as downstream demand from industries like fertilizers and agrochemicals. Additionally, fluctuations in energy costs and geopolitical policies (such as export restrictions) have a significant impact on pricing.

Looking ahead, the yellow phosphorus market is projected to grow at a 5.3% CAGR from USD 5.66 billion in 2025 to USD 9.02 billion by 2034. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to remain dominant due to its agricultural base and proximity to producers. For import-dependent markets like India, monitoring global supply trends, energy costs, and trade policies will be key to managing procurement costs.

Overall, while price volatility persists, strategic procurement and understanding market dynamics offer opportunities for buyers and investors in the yellow phosphorus sector.
